PS4 - DecenMusic 

**Problem Statement**
Music is known to be effective in mood improvement. It has the power to change one's overall frame of mind music also plays a crucial role in changing the atmosphere
and influencing the ambeience of any place. Seeing how much of a great impact music has on everyone's lives we need a stable service to fulfil a a few requirements that would make listening to music a better experience.  


**Problems it solve**
The main issue faced by music artists and record labels in the industry are copyright issues , copying of beats and songs , The Vast Majority of Artists Make No Money and Industry Monopolies 

**Our Approach to the Solution**
We have solved the above problems by introducing the technology of blockchain and decentralised storing solutions which come with it. We have integrated Solidity and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to store music uploaded by the artist ,which creates a unique id and a secure hash for the for the music uploaded giving full authority and ownership of the song to the artist itself , eliminating the problems with copyrights and ownership issues. We have built a business model benefiting both the user and the artist. Since the ownership would be solely to the artist , a vast issue of industrial monopolies of songs and music artist will be eliminated.

**Business Model**
We have kept both the artist and the user in our views and have constructed a well thought model to beneit them both. For Artists, the user can tip any song the user likes , any amount the user wants through blockchain and in cryptocurrency (ethereum) , the artists can opt for a paid promotion marketting which will make the artists song appear on the top of the homepage under 'paid promotions' section. The artist will also be paid via adSense , for which the user may also get the premium version which will block all ads and provide an ad-free streaming service at higher qualities of audio
